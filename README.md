# KalmanFilter

The Unity project is created with Unity version 2021.3.9f1. It should work with any Unity version so long as it has wheel colliders.

Due to the Unity project being too large even when compressed I just uploaded my assets folder. If you do want to load this in Unity I believe that you will need to install TextMeshPro from the package manager

All scripts should be located in the scripts folder.

The KalmanFilter calculations are performed in the KalmanFilter script.

The main script handles updating the Kalman filter and retrieving the filtered velocity values.
