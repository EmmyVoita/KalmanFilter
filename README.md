# KalmanFilter

The Unity project is created with Unity version 2021.3.9f1. It should work with any Unity version so long as it has wheel colliders.

Due to the Unity project being too large even when compressed I just uploaded my assets folder. 

All scripts should be located in the scripts folder in the assets folder

The KalmanFilter calculations are performed in the KalmanFilter script.

The main script handles updating the Kalman filter and reteriving the filtered velocity values.
